<h1 class="google-sans-flex-page-title" style="text-align: center !important;">Real News. Real Analysis. Real Fast.</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">In today’s fast-moving business world, staying informed is only half the battle. The real challenge lies in making sense of the news through the strategic frameworks you’re studying in class. PESTEL analysis, SWOT, Porter’s Diamond, VRIO, Five Forces, or the Diamond-E framework—these powerful tools often feel disconnected from the headlines you read every day. That’s where Business News Miner changes the game.
